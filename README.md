Networking and Scans Automation Tool
Description
This project provides a command-line tool for automating various network scanning and testing tasks using popular utilities like nmap, netcat, and tcpdump. It offers a unified interface for common network operations across different operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).

Features
Network Scanning: Various nmap scan types (quick, intense, comprehensive, etc.)

Port Operations: Listen on ports or create simple servers

Interface Checking: View network interface information

Security Testing: XSS script generation, XML bomb creation

UDP Flooding: Simple UDP packet flooding tool

Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS

Auto-Installation: Checks for and installs required tools

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone [repository-url]
Compile the program:

bash
gcc networking_and_scans_automation.c -o nettool
Usage
Run the program with appropriate flags and arguments:

bash
./nettool [flag] [arguments]
Available Commands
Flag	Description	Arguments Required
  -Ci show ips connected to a host example 192.168.1.1/24
  -sI show ip the machine is connected to
  -sO our typical scan
  -sP default scan with given port
  -iU intense scan plus UDP
  -scs slow comprenhesive scan
  -sa intensive scan, all TCP Ports
  -iN intense scan,no ping
  -i intense scan
  -q quick scan
  -sF default,base nse script,force ipv6:
  -sdb default,base nse script
  -sA default aggresive
  -d6 default force ipv6
  -d default scan
  -l listen to a port
  -c create simple server with port
  -xs xss code creation, a few example codes,eg type ./networking_and_scans_automation -xs flag.txt 192.168.1.10:80
  -xm create xml bomb size given by you
  -spA spam attack
Example

Generate XSS test scripts:
bash
./networking_and_scans_automation -xs flag.txt 192.168.1.10:80
Requirements
The tool will automatically check for and offer to install these dependencies:

nmap

python3

netcat

tcpdump (or windump on Windows), it's on going

Security Note
Some features of this tool (like UDP flooding and XML bomb generation) should only be used for legitimate security testing purposes on systems you own or have permission to test. Always comply with applicable laws and regulations.
